# Checking if two angles are Coterminal

## What are coterminal angles?

Two angles are coterminal if they are drawn in the standard position and both have their terminal sides in the same location. Which means that the angles look identical when drawn on X-Y axes but have different values. This implies that the difference between the angles is a multiple of 360<sup>o</sup> or  2π radians.

Here is an example of coterminal angles α and β

## Example:

The angles 45<sup>o</sup> and 405<sup>o</sup> when drawn on the X-Y plane coincide with each other i.e. have their terminal sides in the same locations.

405<sup>o</sup> - 45<sup>o</sup> = 360<sup>o</sup>

and 360 is obviously a multiple of 360

## Using Our Program:

The program will first ask you to choose the units of angles (Degrees or Radians). Once you choose the units, you provide the angle values to check if they are coterminal or not. The program prints the result message (whether coterminal or not) on the console.
