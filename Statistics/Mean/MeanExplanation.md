# Calculating the Arithmetic Mean of a Set of Numbers

## What is the arithmetic mean?

Note: For the purposes of this file, we will refer to the arithmetic mean as simply the "mean". A mean is a measure of the center of a dataset (or a group of numbers). It is found by computing the sum of numbers in the data divided by the length of the dataset. Keep in mind that it can be heavily skewed by outliers compared to other measures of center, like the Median. The mean is also called the expected value, or average of a dataset. It is often denoted as:

## Calculating the mean

Calculating the mean is simple! Add together all numbers in your dataset, and divide by the number of terms in your data.

As an example, if we wanted to find the mean of the values 4, 9, 6, 7, and 9, we would do the following:

1. Add the numbers together: 4+9+6+7+9 = 35
2. Divide by the number of terms (5): 35/5 = 7

And there we go! The mean of these numbers is 7.

## Using our Program:

The program will prompt you to enter your list of numbers. Please enter each number one at a time, hitting enter after each one. When you are finished, type "done" and hit enter.

After that, the program will compute and output the arithmetic mean!
